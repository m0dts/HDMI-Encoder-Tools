Bits of code for the Brovotech HDMI Encoder box

encoder.py is a python class which has a few functions to control the encoder, i'm using a raspberry pi as the logic control in GB3KM which this is all based on.

The older encoder_control.php is very basic but allows the functions required for the ADALM Pluto to configure the encoder over the network - just for reference.
